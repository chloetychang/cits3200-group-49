## Rundown
> Maureen was actively leading the discussion in the meeting.

- Basic introductions across the team, getting to know baseline, Inquiry on work experiences (Relevant to job/career related)
⁃ Chloe: Project briefing to Maureen (Mentor)
⁃ Maureen: Probing about the app technology used, Recounting experience on client mentioning they want specific XYZ software/tool,
However, “Who from a technology perspective, deemed it’s fit for purpose?”

## Tips from Maureen
⁃ Apart from technicality skills, soft skills being able to work collaboratively is also a key skill.

⁃ Maureen: Establish a tech lead (Who will start reading
documentations on technology used, draft quick prototypes, install instance
and play around with it)
⁃ Maureen: Database migration - Has anyone looked into the
migration pathway? (E.g. any import/export tools, well worn - documentation
available out there)
⁃ Maureen: Re-emphasis from Tri, where it was mentioned that we
would need to directly contact the actual Yanchep tech team regarding
database schema and knowledge (To understand their database
constraints and requirements needed)
⁃ Chloe: Query on sprint 1 deliverable for clients due to this backlog
of software being provided by client. Instead re-assessing promised
deliverable to client (E.g. Providing Database migration plan, instead of actual
migration of database. [Actual migration will be done in sprint 2])
⁃ Chloe: Query to Maureen if there is any value to start with UI/UX
design with current resources available (powerpoint slide deck for GUI)
⁃ Maureen Tips: List down Pros and Cons of doing and not doing,
how much would be thrown away (manpower distribution) + time invested
needed.
⁃ Maureen: Log this key Assumption that Figma/Flutter deployment
works on all platforms [Try it out, design a simple screen and deploy the
basic design to see if tech delivery app works]
⁃ Tri: Highlighted the clients background (Yhub cowering), they tech
software suggested as been tested by them (assumption)
⁃ Maureen & Ryan Tips: Trust but verify
⁃ Tri: Query on acceptance testing resources and guidances
⁃ Maureen: Acceptance Testing and V model (Query back on how
does Prof Michael want these Acceptance Criteria based on the scope
deliverables)
Tips
⁃ Maureen: Always query from a PM standpoint: Test that
assumption that these tools suggested by client (Are they actually
implementable, and if anything goes wrong, it’s the team is liable for this
failure)
⁃ Maureen: List down early assumptions and risks by testing and
documenting early (Such as, using migrations tool to convert from MS
Access to PostgreSQL) [Leading to the importance of assigning key roles
and responsibilities early]
⁃ Maureen: Dependency where another project is making database
changes, you will need to account for these other parties whom would use
these database, etc. [Meeting with other technical stakeholders/project
groups if they have any critical functionalities that they must have]
⁃ Maureen: Emphasis on stating what is out of scope in the work
[E.g. Making database changes/data entry, etc]
⁃ Maureen: Assess the scope requirements, does the client need it
implemented “Yesterday”. [Practical probe, Do they really need to use
PostgreSQL, instead of other technology? Why not just retain using MS
Access] [TLDR: Future proof yourself, to not get chewed by client, gives
team lee-way]
⁃ Maureen: Challenge the scope requir
