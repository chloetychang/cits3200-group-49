## Rundown
> Maureen was actively leading the discussion in the meeting.

- Basic introductions across the team, getting to know baseline, Inquiry on work experiences (Relevant to job/career related)

- Chloe: Project briefing to Maureen (Mentor)

- Maureen: Probing about the app technology used, Recounting experience on client mentioning they want specific XYZ software/tool,
However, “Who from a technology perspective, deemed it’s fit for purpose?”

- Maureen: Database migration - Has anyone looked into the migration pathway? (E.g. any import/export tools, well worn - documentation
available out there)

- Maureen: Re-emphasis from Tri, where it was mentioned that we would need to directly contact the actual Yanchep tech team regarding
database schema and knowledge (To understand their database constraints and requirements needed)

- Chloe: Query on sprint 1 deliverable for clients due to this backlog of software being provided by client. Instead re-assessing promised deliverable to client (E.g. Providing Database migration plan, instead of actual migration of database. [Actual migration will be done in sprint 2])

- Chloe: Query to Maureen if there is any value to start with UI/UX design with current resources available (powerpoint slide deck for GUI)

- Maureen: Log this key Assumption that Figma/Flutter deployment works on all platforms.
    - Try it out, design a simple screen and deploy the basic design to see if tech delivery app works.

- Tri: Highlighted the clients background (Yhub cowering), the tech software suggested should have been tested by them.

- Tri: Query on acceptance testing resources and guidances.

## Tips from Maureen
⁃ Apart from technicality skills, soft skills being able to work collaboratively is also a key skill.

- Make sure the technology suggested by the client actually enables the Team to complete all requirements requested for the final deliverable. Don't simply rely on assumptions. Test elements in the tech stack out. 
    - Otherwise the tech team would be the party with major responsibility for failing to deliver the project.
    - Always query from a PM standpoint: Test that assumption that these tools suggested by client (Are they actually implementable, and if anything goes wrong, it’s the team is liable for this failure)
    
- Account for dependencies.
    - For example, when it comes to the dependency of a database - since web application should fetch data from the specific database, if another project involves making database changes, you will need to account for these other parties who would modify the database, etc.         
        - Meeting with other technical stakeholders/project groups if they have any critical functionalities that they must have, or are about to add.
        
- Emphasis on stating what is out of scope in the work [E.g. Making database changes/data entry, etc]
    - Assess the scope requirements, does the client need it implemented “Yesterday”?
    - For example: Is migrating to PostgreSQL a necessity for the Project? Why not just retain using Microsoft Access, or consider other technological solutions? Future-proof yourself.

- Challenge the scope requirements along the way with the client, treat each interaction as a collaboration

- List down early assumptions and risks by testing and documenting early (Such as, using migrations tool to convert from MS
Access to PostgreSQL) 
    - Leads to the importance of assigning key roles and responsibilities early.
    
- Trust but verify assumptions. For example: The assumption that the technology suggested by the client is the most optimal for this project should be confirmed through testing.

- Establish a tech lead 
    - Role: Will start reading documentations on technology used, draft quick prototypes, install instance and play around with it.
    
- List down Pros and Cons of doing and not doing. How much would be thrown away (manpower distribution) + time invested
needed.
    - Consider Opportunity Cost. What can the people who are working on this particular component do instead? Would it be more beneficial for the team if these individuals work on something else, perhaps on requirements with higher priority?
    
- Acceptance Testing and V model (Query back on how does Prof Michael want these Acceptance Criteria based on the scope deliverables)

## Action Items
Chloe: 
- Send meeting invitation for mentor meeting (3-4PM), for the rest of the mentor meetings
- Set up WhatsApp Chat group for Communication [Done]

Everyone: 
- Probe if the technology required from clients are actually implementable for the success of the project. 

## Closing
- Meeting Closed: 4:00pm
- Next Scheduled Client Meeting: 27th August 3-4PM
