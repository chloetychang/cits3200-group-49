## Item 1 - Review of how well the team has met project goals and user stories set in sprint 1.
> **Strong focus on the process of the team meeting the goals and what can be improved.**

### Discussion
 - Tri: Well on-track to finishing project goals. Is everyone in agreement of that?
    - Biggest reflection in terms of process: We haven't really implemented a complete MVP. Stress at the end of Sprint 2 is due to the delayed implementation of backend. Didn't design the timeline in mind with Sprint 2 and Sprint 3 in mind.
    
- Chloe: I would say that this is due to us working with a new tech stack that has not been utilised previously. Sprint 2 and 3 should be designed with the tech stack in mind. Especially accounting for the whole project, frontend should be near-completion before we commence work on backend, due to us having to merge flutter from the flutterflow branch into main, and the flutterflow branch easily overrides main, disrupting other workflow. This has not been previously considered, as we thought we would work on frontend and backend simultaneously. Turns out, this is not the optimal method, and near-full frontend functionality should be implemented before starting on backend with the utilisation of flutterflow.

- Tri: As a result, we have an unexpected situation that the progress of components vary between each other, with some being more developed, bordering fully developed, which has not been intended previously. We also commenced testing earlier than expected, to ensure the frontend component and data migration have near-complete functionality and responsiveness due to the flutterflow overriding situation, which has not been foreseen until further testing and experimentation with the tech stack. 

- Ryan: Underutilisation of human resources at the start of the project. Worked on the set-up of the backend, commenting on the backend workflow. 
    - Can't really ensure the backend is ready until there is a database to work with. Started backend development when database migration is complete. Could have started it earlier.
    - Comment on team dynamics: Team responded well to time constraints and change in critical path, once we have delved into the tech stack.

- Naren and Tri: Comment on database migration. Have preliminary versions of PostgreSQL database that could have helped with working on backend, but never started implementing it in API.
    - However, client did mention that there will be potential ongoing database modification, which should be accounted for, delaying database migration due to uncertainty in database and schema requirements.

- Tri: Reflect on communication: How frontend sub-division is more cohesive than database migration team. 
    - Frontend team appears to be more collaborative compared to database migration team. 
        - Database migration team: Two people working on two separate data migration schemes, leading to redundant work.
    - Dennis and Harper: Overcoming restrictions on flutterflow, rotation schedule set-up with only one member of the team being able to work on editing the document at a time. Team knows each other's approximate availability for quick communication and demonstrations over call.
    - Harper: Backend preparation should be commence or researched while waiting on Kevin's feedback.
    - Communication should be enhanced to avoid the creation of blockers on the completion of work. Also have to account for all team members' additional (unit) commitments.

- Chloe: Comment on her appreciation of the team. Relatively equal contribution from everyone. Everyone can be reached so far and responds promptly.

## Item 2 - Review of expected timeline and hours estimates.
> **The team to assess timesheet and discuss discrepancies in estimations and timeline.**

### Discussion
- Tri: General Tasks - Overestimated Learning Techniques and Tasks, combined with Research and Investigation
- Chloe: Frontend - a lot of the learning techniques and tasks are combined into system design
- Tri: More to reflect on regarding the Requirement timesheet compared to General Tasks timesheet.
- Tri: Initial estimation of Frontend was shorter than expected. Actual (Frontend): 60 hours, Expected (Frontend): 36 hours. 
    - Expected to finish Frontend by Week 5-6. Finished Frontend around start of Week 7, only ended up getting 1 week to work on backend.
    - Chloe: However, frontend finalised testing as well by Week 7, which was not part of the Sprint 2 goals but will aid future development.

- Tri: Finishing database migration earlier than expected, expecting completion by Week 9. Completed migration by late Week 7. Actual: ~40 hours, Expected: 60 hours.
    - Result: Having more hands to work on backend simultaneously. Original plan - 4 people to work on backend, 2 people to work on database. Current plan - 4 people to work on backend, 2 people to work on backend testing.
    - Naren: Acknowledge the capabilities of each teammate - strengths and weaknesses. Need to think of that to allocate manpower efficiently.
        - Chloe: However, we need to account for technology restrictions, given that some components can only be completion on a Windows machine (database migration). 
        - Ryan: Going forward, we should adapt a strategy (emphasis on availabilities and micro-meetings), which is similar to the proven method implemented by the frontend team. 

- Tri: Merging the hours allocated to out-of-scope requirements into backend development, based on ongoing communication with Kevin.
    - In the future, there will be a stronger emphasis on test design and quality assurance.

- Chloe: Some of us have more work allocated at the start of the project, due to frontend and database migration requirements and timeline arrangements. Some of us will have an increase in workload at the end of the project, with a focus on backend. Time allocated to this unit will be roughly equal between all members, which is ideal.

## Item 3 - Sprint 3:
> **Internal Team Retrospective**

### Discussion
- Tri: In action, plans that we want to change regarding our work process.
- Chloe: Make sure people know what the next step of action is. Make it straightforward. For example, one person will know that they are responsible for one set of pages, while the other person will have another set that they are responsible for. Allows distinctive components to be completed.
- Tri: Create a list of tasks?
    - Chloe: Suggestion of GitHub workflow. Megalist of Issues. People can assign themselves tasks from the list. Something to implement near the middle of Sprint 3. 

## Overall Actions - Referencing Improvements in Workflow.
- Everyone: To enhance a sense of collaboration in the team. Create a more cohesive workflow with reference to the frontend strategy.
    - Frontend: Team knows each other's approximate availability for quick communication and demonstrations over call. Frequent workflow updates.

- Everyone: Create a list of tasks near backend completion, so people know what to do regarding the finalisation and wrapping up of project. Reference GitHub workflows (let Chloe know when it's time to implement the task list on GitHub - happy to help).

## Meeting Closed: 6:00pm

## Next Scheduled Meeting: Client Retrospective - 18th September, 2025 (Thursday). 12:00-1:00PM.
